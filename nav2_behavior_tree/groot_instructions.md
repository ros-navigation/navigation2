# Instructions on using Groot
[Groot](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot) is the companion application of [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) to create, edit, and monitor behavior trees.

##### Note: Currently fully supports visualization of the behavior trees. It also supports the creation of custom nodes except control flow nodes. Support for custom control flow nodes and real-time monitoring is under development.

/** @brief Type of sequence node that keeps tickinng through all the children until all children
 * return SUCCESS
 *
 * Type of Control Node  | Child Returns Failure | Child Returns Running
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NonblockingSequence   |      Restart          | Continue tickng next child
 *
 * Continue ticking next child means every node after the running node will be ticked. Even
 * if a previous node returns Running or Success, the subsequent nodes will be reticked.
 *
 * As an example, let's say this node has 3 children: A, B and C. At the start,
 * they are all IDLE.
 * |    A    |    B    |    C    |
 * --------------------------------
 * |  IDLE   |  IDLE   |   IDLE  |
 * | RUNNING |  IDLE   |   IDLE  |  - at first A gets ticked. Assume it returns RUNNING
 *                                  - NonblockingSequence returns RUNNING and continues to the next
 *                                  - node.
 * | RUNNING | RUNNING | RUNNING |  - Eventually all nodes will be in the running state and
 *                                  - NonblockingSequence returns RUNNING
 * | SUCCESS | RUNNING | SUCCESS |  - Even in a configuration where there are multiple nodes
 *                                  - returning SUCCESS, NonblockingSequence continues on ticking all.
 *                                  - nodes each time it is ticked and returns RUNNING. Note that even
 *                                  - if a node returns `SUCCESS`, on the next tick, it will attempt to
 *                                  - restart the node. This is too ensure that successful nodes do
 *                                  - not latch a stale state while waiting for another long running
 *                                  - node to be complete
 * | SUCCESS | SUCCESS | SUCCESS |  - If all child nodes return SUCCESS the NonblockingSequence
 *                                  - returns SUCCESS
 *
 * If any children at any time had returned FAILURE. NonblockingSequence would have returned FAILURE
 * and halted all children, ending the sequence.
 *
 * Usage in XML: <NonblockingSequence>

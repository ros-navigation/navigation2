/**
 * @class OscillationCritic
 * @brief Checks to see whether the sign of the commanded velocity flips frequently
 *
 * This critic figures out if the commanded trajectories are oscillating by seeing
 * if one of the dimensions (x,y,theta) flips from positive to negative and then back
 * (or vice versa) without moving sufficiently far or waiting sufficiently long.
 *
 * Scenario 1: Robot moves one meter forward, and then two millimeters backward.
 * Another forward motion would be considered oscillating, since the x dimension would then
 * flip from positive to negative and then back to negative. Hence, when scoring different
 * trajectories, positive velocity commands will get the oscillation_score (-5.0, or invalid)
 * and only negative velocity commands will be considered valid.

 * Scenario 2: Robot moves one meter forward, and then one meter backward.
 * The robot has thus moved one meter since flipping the sign of the x direction, which
 * is greater than our oscillation_reset_dist, so its not considered oscillating, so all
 * trajectories are considered valid.
 *
 * Note: The critic will only check oscillations in the x dimension while it exceeds
 * a particular value (x_only_threshold_). If it dips below that magnitude, it will
 * also check for oscillations in the y and theta dimensions. If x_only_threshold_ is
 * negative, then the critic will always check all dimensions.
 *
 * Implementation Details:
 * The critic saves the robot's current position when it prepares, and what the actual
 * commanded velocity was during the debrief step. Upon debriefing, if the sign of any of
 * dimensions has flipped since the last command, the position is saved as prev_stationary_pose_.
 *
 * If the linear or angular distance from prev_stationary_pose_ to the current pose exceeds
 * the limits, the oscillation flags are reset so the previous sign change is no longer remembered.
 * This assumes that oscillation_reset_dist_ or oscillation_reset_angle_ are positive. Otherwise,
 * it uses a time based delay reset function.

 * @class PathAlignCritic
 * @brief Scores trajectories based on how far from the global path the front of the robot ends up.
 *
 * This uses the costmap grid as a proxy for calculating which way the robot should be facing relative
 * to the global path. Instead of scoring how far the center of the robot is away from the global path,
 * this critic calculates how far a point forward_point_distance in front of the robot is from the global
 * path. This biases the planner toward trajectories that line up with the global plan.
 *
 * When the robot is near the end of the path, the scale of this critic is set to zero. When the projected
 * point is past the global goal, we no longer want this critic to try to align to a part of the global path
 * that isn't there.

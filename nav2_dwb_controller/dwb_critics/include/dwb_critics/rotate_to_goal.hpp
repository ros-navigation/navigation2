/**
 * @class RotateToGoalCritic
 * @brief Forces the commanded trajectories to only be rotations if within a certain distance window
 *
 * This used to be built in to the DWA Local Planner as the LatchedStopRotate controller,
 * but has been moved to a critic for consistency.
 *
 * The critic has three distinct phases.
 *  1) If the current pose is outside xy_goal_tolerance LINEAR distance from the goal pose, this critic
 *     will just return score 0.0.
 *  2) If within the xy_goal_tolerance and the robot is still moving with non-zero linear motion, this critic
 *     will only allow trajectories that are slower than the current speed in order to stop the robot (within
 *     the robot's acceleration limits). The returned score will be the robot's linear speed squared, multiplied
 *     by the slowing_factor parameter (default 5.0) added to the result of scoreRotation.
 *  3) If within the xy_goal_tolerance and the robot has sufficiently small linear motion, this critic will
 *     score trajectories that have linear movement as invalid and score the rest based on the result of the
 *     scoreRotation method
 *
 * The scoreRotation method can be overridden, but the default behavior is to return the shortest angular distance
 * between the goal pose and a pose from the trajectory. Which pose depends on the lookahead_time parameter.
 *  * If the lookahead_time parameter is negative, the pose evaluated will be the last pose in the trajectory,
 *    which is the same as DWA's behavior. This is the default.
 *  * Otherwise, a new pose will be projected using the dwb_local_planner::projectPose. By using a lookahead
 *    time shorter than sim_time, the critic will be less concerned about overshooting the goal yaw and thus will
 *    continue to turn faster for longer.

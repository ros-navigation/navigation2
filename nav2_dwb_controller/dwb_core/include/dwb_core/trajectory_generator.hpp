 * This class defines the plugin interface for two separate but related components.
 *
 * First, this class provides an iterator interface for exploring all of the velocities
 * to search, given the current velocity.
 *
 * Second, the class gives an independent interface for creating a trajectory from a twist,
 * i.e. projecting it out in time and space.
 *
 * Both components rely heavily on the robot's kinematic model, and can share many parameters,
 * which is why they are grouped into a singular class.

 * @class TrajectoryCritic
 * @brief Evaluates a Trajectory2D to produce a score
 *
 * This class defines the plugin interface for the TrajectoryCritic which
 * gives scores to trajectories, where lower numbers are better, but negative
 * scores are considered invalid.
 *
 * The general lifecycle is
 *  1) initialize is called once at the beginning which in turn calls onInit.
 *       Derived classes may override onInit to load parameters as needed.
 *  2) prepare is called once before each set of trajectories.
 *       It is presumed that there are multiple trajectories that we want to evaluate,
 *       and there may be some shared work that can be done beforehand to optimize
 *       the scoring of each individual trajectory.
 *  3) scoreTrajectory is called once per trajectory and returns the score.
 *  4) debrief is called after each set of trajectories with the chosen trajectory.
 *       This can be used for stateful critics that monitor the trajectory through time.
 *
 *  Optionally, there is also a debugging mechanism for certain types of critics in the
 *  addCriticVisualization method. If the score for a trajectory depends on its relationship to
 *  the costmap, addCriticVisualization can provide that information to the dwb_core
 *  which will publish the grid scores as a PointCloud2.

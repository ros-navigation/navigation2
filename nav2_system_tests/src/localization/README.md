# Localization Testing

The intention of the localization test is to ensure robotâ€™s pose and transforms are available.

Currently, only a simple test that checks the `initialpose` has been implemented.  The `test_localization` module publishes an initial pose on `initialpose` topic and then it listens to `amcl_pose` topic. If the `amcl_pose` is similar to `initial pose` within a predefined tolerance the test passes.

## To run the test
First, build the package
```
colcon build --symlink-install
```
After building, from /build/nav2_system_tests directory run:
```
ctest -V -R test_localization
```
Alternately you can run all the tests in the package using colcon:
```
colcon test --packages-select nav2_system_tests
```

## Future Plan
Once rosbag functionality becomes available, this test can be extended to utilize a recorded trajectory with map and scan data to monitor the `amcl_pose` and `transforms` without a need to run Gazebo and map_server.

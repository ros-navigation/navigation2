# To use this script, run the `test_updown_reliablity` script and log the output

# results

# This reports the number of successful tests, but also the number of times the
# tests were able to make it to the active state as well as the shutdown state.
# It can frequently occur that the system makes all the lifecycle state transitions
# but has an error during the final process termination.

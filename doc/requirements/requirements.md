# ROS 2 Navigation System Requirements

The ROS 2 Navigation System ("Navigation System") is the control system that enables a robot to autonomously reach a goal state, such as a specific position and orientation relative to a given map. Provided with a navigation command to execute, the Navigation System generates a plan to achieve the desired result and outputs control commands to autonomously direct the robot, respecting any safety constraints and avoiding obstacles encountered along the way.

This document lists the requirements for the ROS 2 Navigation System. The ROS 2 Navigation System is intended to be a generalization of the ROS 1 navigation stack and will address some of its known limitations.

# 1. Introduction

This section describes the format of each requirement, the keywords available for use in the definition of each requirement, and the basic concepts needed to define and understand the requirements.

## 1.1 Requirement Fields

Each requirement is presented in tabular form with the following fields:

* **Id** - A unique identifier for the requirement
* **Handle** - A short, scoped, description summarizing the essence of the requirement
* **Priority** - An associated priority level: **1** (high), **2** (medium), and **3** (low)
* **Requirement** - The requirement itself, stated in clear, concise requirements language
* **Notes** - Elaboration and related information for the requirement

## 1.2 Requirement Language Keywords

In the requirements specified below, certain keywords have a specific meaning as they appear in the text. These keywords are defined as follows and must be capitalized whenever used in a manner intended to specify a behavior or requirement.

1. **MUST**: This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

2. **MUST NOT**: This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.

3. **SHOULD**: This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

4. **SHOULD NOT**: This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.

5. **MAY**: This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides).

These definitions are derived from the [IETF Best Current Practices Document 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14).

## 1.3 Terminology

This section defines some common terminology as used in this document.

Term | Definition
---- | ----------
Path | A *Path* is an ordered sequence of points in space.
Route | A *Route* is a synonym for Path.
Trajectory | A *Trajectory* is a path parameterized by time.
Path Planning | *Path Planning* refers to the process of finding an optimal path between multiple locations. Path planning is typically characterized as a graph traversal problem and algorithms such as A*, D*, and RRT are common choices for implementation.
Motion Planning | *Motion Planning* refers to the process of specifying the motion of the robot over time to follow a specific path.

## 1.4 Use Cases

The Navigation System is part of a larger system that includes a person or automated system ("the user") directing the operation of one or more robots. To provide context for the Navigation System, this section lists the expected interactions between the user and the robot system.

## 1.4.1 Mapping Use Cases

The user will typically create a map of the area in which the robot is to navigate, either manually or using the SLAM algorithm. This map identifies significant features of the environment, including fixed features, such as walls and fixed obstacles, and virtual features, such as navigation lanes and safety zones. While the creation of the map itself is outside the scope of the Navigation System, the system is dependent on the map format(s). The map will need to be rich enough to support the Navigation System requirements listed in this document.

The following use case diagram shows an example of the kinds of operations provided by a mapping interface.

![Mapping Use Cases](./images/Mapping-Use-Cases.png)

## 1.4.2 Mission Planning Use Cases

Another area in which the user interacts with the system is in the creation of a mission plan for the robot. The user composes a sequence of primitive navigation commands, such as **Navigate to Pose**, **Navigate to Area**, **Maintain Pose**, etc., into an overall plan. While mission planning is also outside the scope of the Navigation System, the mission plan format should be sufficient to meet the Navigation System requirements listed in this document.

![Mission Planning Use Cases](./images/Mission-Planning-Use-Cases.png)

## 1.4.3 Mission Execution Use Cases

The user will be able to initiate the execution of specific mission plans ("missions") and should also be able to view the status of the mission in progress, as well as cancel the mission that is currently in progress. In addition, the user may be required to provide the robot with its initial pose if the robot is not able to determine it automatically.

![Mission Execution Use Cases](./images/Mission-Execution-Use-Cases.png)

## 1.5 Architectural Components

The Navigation System is part of a larger software system. This document does not specify the architecture for the complete system, but simply gives a conceptual overview for the purpose of requirements definition.

The Navigation System has a *command chain*, where each level refines its command input into successively more specific operations for the lext level down, and *support modules* which are used by modules in the command chain.

## 1.5.1 Command Chain

The command chain is the sequence of modules that comprise the chain of command from the user, at the top, to the robot, at the bottom.

* **Mission Planning** - Mission Planning provides an interface to the user to allow the user to create mission plans and assign them to robots for execution. A *Mission Plan* is a sequence of *Navigation Commands* along with associated information about how the commands should be carried out.
* **Mission Execution** - Mission Execution receives the Mission Plan and is responsible to execute the plan and report progress on its execution.
* **Navigation System** - The Navigation System receives a segment of an overall plan to execute (a *Navigation Command*) and generates the control commands to the robot to carry it out.
* **Robot Interface** - The Robot Interface is an abstraction of the robot platform, providing the means for the Navigation System to control the robot, learn about its capabilities, and receive feedback from the robot.

The following diagram shows the modules in the command chain and the successive refinement of the control commands:

![Command Chain](./images/Context.png)

The Navigation System itself can be decomposed into two general responsibilities, *Planning*, and *Execution*.

* **Planning** - The Planning Module is responsible to execute Navigation Commands. To do so, this module can evaluate input maps and continually assess the robot's environment to plan motion and provide the path for the robot to follow to achieve completion of the Navigation Command.
* **Execution** - The Execution Module is responsible to execute the path provided by Planning, generating the control commands required to follow the path.

![Navigation System](./images/Navigation-System.png)

Decomposing the Navigation System, the overall command chain is as follows:

![Command Pipeline](./images/Command-Pipeline.png)

## 1.5.2 Support Modules

In addition to the command chain, there are several supporting modules and subsystems required for a complete system. The implementation of these modules is outside the scope of the Navigation System. However, the interface to these components is in scope and the associated requirements should be defined. Together, the support modules provide the robot with a full picture of the robot's environment.

* **Mapping** - The Mapping Subsystem generates maps that can be used by the Navigation System to plan the robot's motion. Maps are typically created in advance and are available to the Navigation System. A map can be updated to reflect changes in the environment. The frequency of these updates will vary among implementations.
* **Perception** - The Perception Subsystem utilizes sensors to develop an understanding of the dynamic environment around the robot. This information is available to the Navigation System, such as when avoiding obstacles in the robot's path.
* **Prediction** - The Prediction Subsystem anticipates future motion trajectories of any perceived objects.
* **Localization** - The Localization Subsystem provides the current location of the robot.

In a complete robot system these modules are available to the core navigation modules (the command chain), as shown in the following diagram:

![Command Pipeline with Support](./images/With-Support-Modules.png)

To facilitate error recovery, each module in the command chain, if it is unable to carry out its task, should be able to propagate error information to its predecessor in the chain.

## 1.6 Design Goals

The Navigation System should meet the following high-level design goals:

* **Extensibility** - The Navigation System should be a *pluggable framework* to allow for other developers to easily extend the capabilities of the Navigation System, such as adding the ability to handle new navigation commands.
* **Modularity** - The Navigation System should allow developers to *easily replace components* with alternative implementations.
* **Generality** - The Navigation System should not introduce inherent limitations in the architectural blocks. For example, it should support multiple kinds of robots, not making assumptions about robot capabilities and limitations and should support various map types and orientations.
* **Performance** - *TODO: What are the performance goals?*
* **Scalability** - *TODO: What are the scalability goals?*
* *TODO: Other important design goals to call out?*

## 2.3 Command Chain Modules

This section lists the requirements for the core command chain modules in the Navigation System.

### 2.3.1 Mission Planning

A complete system should have some kind of Mission Planning subsystem to convey the user's intentions to the robot. The User interacts with this Mission Planning subsystem to generate a Mission Plan for the robot. The Mission Plan is defined as a sequence of Navigation Commands, along with any associated information about how and when the plan should be carried out. The design and implementation of a Mission Planning subsystem is outside the scope of the Navigation System. However, in order to understand the larger system context and how Mission Planning interacts with the Navigation System, this section will consider the nature of a mission plan and the kinds of operations it may contain.

### 2.3.2 Mission Execution

The Mission Execution module has the responsibility to execute a provided mission. It provides each successive Navigation Command to the Navigation Subsystem, monitoring and reporting progress towards completion of the plan.

ME012 | Mission Execution.Safe State Upon Failure | 1 | If the Mission Execution module is unable to execute the mission, it MUST direct the robot to a safe state. | The failure could be for a variety of reasons - sensor failures, algorithmic failure, a collision, etc.
ME013 | Mission Execution.Selection of Planners | 1 | The Navigation System SHOULD allow the association and use of specific Planning and Execution Modules for a given Navigation Command. | For example, a user may want to have components for classic point-A-to-point-B travel, but upon reaching point B, have specialized components that control a series of maneuvers such as docking to a charging station or a conveyor belt.

### 2.3.3 Navigation System.Planning

The Navigation System's Planning Module receives the Navigation Command from the Mission Execution module and is responsible to implement that command.

* What are the scalability for the ROS2 Navigation System?
* Any other important design goals to call out?
* Should we specify a minimum target platform? Or, should this be expressed as minimum platform requirements?
* What is the right latency value for detecting a collision? 
* Should we add any safety-related functionality at the robot interface level? 
* Do safety zones need unique names?
